# Details

This is a simulation project done completely in Java. This project simulates a natural environement where we have plants, herbivores, carnivores and omnivores. 
All of the organisms are able to live in this environment based on a set of rule (their food consumption, speed of reproduction etc.) and the rule of food chain (Herbivores eats plans etc.). Of course, all
these organisms can reproduce offsprings as well.
<br>

This application will be able to return the result, after a set number of cycles (days), how many organisms of each types are left.
